Hi, I'm Riley! Some things about me:

- I really enjoy being an engineer. Tinkering with computers has proven to be one of the most fun and fulfilling things I have ever done :)
- I'm a father to two beautiful girls, and I'm married to a beautiful, dynamic, and wonderful woman
- I worked as a board game designer for 2 years, [this game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/badcrow/company-of-heroes-board-game) was my main project
- I was a cheerleader in highschool, a racquetball player in college, and pickleball is my current obsession
