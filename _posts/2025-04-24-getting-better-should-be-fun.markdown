title:  "Getting Better Should Be Fun"

Recently a computer science student asked me what he should do in order to improve his skills. It occured to me that there are a tons of technologies to research, leet code to grind, patterns to memorize, and todo apps to build... Where to start? Thinking about this question has helped me to clarify a principle that has been critical to my growth:

> You will be better at your craft if you enjoy it

Let's clarify a couple things about that statement. I'm not saying that hard work doesn't have it's place. All you "rise and grinders" can put your pitchforks and dumbells away. Learning new skills can be uncomfortable, stretching, and frustrating.

However, if programming is **only** uncomfortable and frustrating, then you are not going to improve for long, and you will be miserable. That’s like plowing a field with a lawn chair — you can technically do it, but your harvest will probably suck.

The best engineers I know are excited about what they do. The reason is that enjoying engineering will push you to do some remarkable things. You will learn faster, dive deeper, and in my experience work longer. As an example of wild things you do while having fun, I'm writing this blog post at 3 in the morning. I couldn't sleep and I was excited about my little website :)

## "I have stuff to do"

The trouble is that learning to enjoy programming takes consistent time. You probably have expectations on your time, either from your job, your classes, or your wallet. Sometimes our work gives us some flexibility to work on things that are fun, but that isn't always the case. I have found that I can not rely on my job to consistently teach me how to enjoy my craft.

So that leaves us with time outside of work. But you are assuredly busy with the billion other things that make up your life, and fitting in time for more "work" is only going to burn you out more... Quite the conundrum.

## Play for its own sake

The trick is to pick a "free time" project that is fun. The only criteria is that you should enjoy doing it. And as soon as it stops being fun? Abandon it! You probably learned some stuff, so throw away your guilt and go find something else that is fun to build.

Here are some ideas that have worked for me:

- Make a video game in 24 hours. It will be a hot mess, and that is great
- Find an open source project that you like and try contributing to the code base
- Build a joke repository ([here](https://github.com/RileyGabrielson/the-identity) is one I made recently, it was a blast)
- Make a personal website with markdown
- Install Arch on an old computer, then drop "I use Arch btw" in random contexts
- Learn vim keybindings (and then probably spend 6 months rewriting your neovim config)
- Make a silly project as a present for a family member (I made a really terrible "Among Us" clone for my sister's birthday years ago, we still talk about it)

## Transitive Property

The exciting part of these fun, silly projects is that you will learn to love being an engineer, and your work will become way more enjoyable as a result. You will make connections that your peers won't, you will be more creative in your problem solving, and it will become a lot easier to view what you do as a craft rather than a job.

**Find the fun** maybe a bit cliche, but go try it anyway. You deserve to be happy, and you'll be a better engineer because of it.

This kitten is pretty inspiring :)
